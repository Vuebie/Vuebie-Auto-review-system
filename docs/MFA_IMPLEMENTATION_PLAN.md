# MFA Implementation Plan for Vuebie

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in the Vuebie application using Supabase Auth. The plan addresses the requirements specified in the project scope to enable MFA for admin users.

## Current Status
Based on code review and project analysis:
- MFA is defined in the database schema but not implemented
- The `MerchantProfile` table has an `mfa_enabled` field (boolean)
- Placeholder comments exist for future MFA implementation
- Required packages (TOTP and QR code generation) are listed in dependencies

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Supabase MFA Configuration
- Configure Supabase Auth to enable TOTP MFA
- Set up the required settings through Supabase Dashboard
- Update authentication configuration as needed

### 2. MFA Components Development

#### Backend Components
1. Create MFA Helper Functions:
   - `enrollMFA`: Generate and save TOTP secret for a user
   - `verifyTOTP`: Verify a TOTP code against stored secret
   - `generateRecoveryCodes`: Create and store backup codes
   - `verifyRecoveryCode`: Check recovery code validity
   - `updateMFAStatus`: Update user's MFA enrollment status

2. Update Authentication Flow:
   - Modify login process to check for MFA requirement
   - Add MFA verification step in authentication pipeline
   - Update session handling to track MFA verification status

#### Frontend Components
1. MFA Setup Page:
   - Create new route `/settings/security/mfa/setup`
   - Implement QR code display for authenticator apps
   - Add TOTP verification during setup
   - Generate and display recovery codes

2. MFA Login Component:
   - Create MFA verification step after password authentication
   - Add recovery code option for account recovery
   - Implement proper error handling and rate limiting

3. MFA Management Page:
   - Enable/disable MFA toggle in user settings
   - Recovery codes regeneration
   - MFA reset functionality for admins

### 3. Enforce MFA for Admin Roles
- Implement role-based MFA enforcement
- Force MFA setup for admin and super_admin roles
- Redirect admins without MFA to setup page

### 4. Security Enhancements
- Add rate limiting for TOTP verification attempts
- Implement secure storage of TOTP secrets
- Log all MFA-related activities (setup, verification, disable)

### 5. Testing Plan
- Test MFA setup flow with Google Authenticator
- Verify TOTP code validation works correctly
- Test recovery using backup codes
- Confirm admin MFA enforcement
- Verify security measures (rate limiting, logging)

## Timeline
- Day 1: Supabase configuration and backend MFA helper functions
- Day 2: Frontend MFA setup and verification components
- Day 3: Testing, fixes, and documentation

## Dependencies
- Supabase Auth (JWT handling)
- TOTP library (e.g., otplib)
- QR code generation library
- Secure storage for TOTP secrets

## Security Considerations
- TOTP secrets must be encrypted in storage
- Recovery codes must use secure hashing
- Rate limiting should prevent brute force attacks
- All MFA events should be logged for audit
