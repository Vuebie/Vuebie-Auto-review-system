# MFA Implementation Status Update

## Current Status: Configuration Issues Resolved âœ…

We have successfully identified and resolved the configuration issues that were affecting the MFA implementation. The core issue was a mismatch between environment variable naming conventions and the Vue.js framework requirements.

## Resolved Issues

| Issue | Resolution | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Environment variable naming mismatch | Updated to use `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` | âœ… Completed |
| Multiple Supabase client implementations | Identified correct Vue.js client implementation | âœ… Completed |
| Framework compatibility | Verified Vue.js specific configuration | âœ… Completed |
| Connection testing | Created test script to verify Supabase connectivity | âœ… Completed |

## Pending Items for MFA Implementation

| Task | Description | Status | Priority |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| MFA Enrollment Testing | Test admin user enrollment flow | ðŸŸ  Pending | High |
| MFA Login Testing | Test TOTP code verification during login | ðŸŸ  Pending | High |
| Recovery Code Testing | Verify backup code functionality | ðŸŸ  Pending | High |
| Rate Limiting Testing | Confirm protection against brute force attacks | ðŸŸ  Pending | Medium |
| MFA Event Logging | Verify events appear in security_events table | ðŸŸ  Pending | Medium |
| User Documentation | Create guide for MFA setup and usage | ðŸŸ  Pending | Medium |

## Updated Environment Configuration

The `.env` file has been verified to contain the correct configuration for Vue.js:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://puldndhrobcaeogmjflj.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=[Redacted for security]
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Execute the MFA testing plan to verify functionality
2. **Short-term**: Document test results and any additional fixes required
3. **Mid-term**: Create user documentation for MFA setup
4. **Long-term**: Consider additional authentication methods (WebAuthn/FIDO2)

## Conclusion

The configuration issues that were potentially affecting MFA implementation have been resolved. The system is now ready for comprehensive testing to verify the functionality works as expected before marking Week 2 as complete.
