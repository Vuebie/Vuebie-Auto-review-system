## Recommendations

1. **Security Improvements**:
   - Move Supabase URL and keys to environment variables
   - Set up proper .env.example and .env.local files
   - Enhance .gitignore to prevent secrets from being committed

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Remove test content, placeholders, and console.logs
   - Complete a thorough audit of AIvue → Vuebie rebranding
   - Implement consistent error handling across the application

3. **Testing & QA**:
   - Increase test coverage for critical user flows
   - Implement accessibility testing
   - Conduct performance testing on slower connections

4. **Monitoring & Operations**:
   - Set up error logging and monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
   - Implement health checks for critical services
   - Document backup and recovery procedures

5. **Documentation & Standards**:
   - Update README with accurate framework information
   - Create a deployment checklist for production releases
   - Document environment separation strategy
