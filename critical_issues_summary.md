# Summary of Critical Issues in Vuebie Project

Based on the comprehensive QA assessment, here are the 5 most important issues that need immediate attention:

1. **Security Vulnerability** - Supabase URL and anonymous key are hardcoded directly in the source code (src/lib/supabase-client.ts) instead of using environment variables, creating a significant security risk.

2. **Development Artifacts in Production** - Test content including a prominent red test banner is still present in App.tsx, along with other placeholder content and console logs throughout the codebase.

3. **Incomplete Rebranding** - The transition from AIvue to Vuebie appears incomplete, requiring a thorough audit to ensure all references to the old brand name have been updated consistently.

4. **Insufficient Error Handling & Monitoring** - No error logging or monitoring tools (like Sentry) are implemented, and error handling for API requests is inconsistent across the application.

5. **Limited Test Coverage** - Testing appears limited with only partial coverage of critical components and user flows, and no evidence of accessibility or performance testing.

These issues should be prioritized for resolution before production deployment.
