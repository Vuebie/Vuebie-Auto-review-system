# Framework Compatibility Issues Fixed

## Executive Summary

Author: David  

This document outlines the framework compatibility issues discovered and fixed in the Vuebie MFA implementation. The primary issue was that the Supabase project was incorrectly configured for Next.js, while our application uses Vite/React, causing environment variable mismatches and client configuration problems.

## Issues Discovered

1. **Environment Variable Mismatch**
   - Supabase environment variables were using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix instead of the required `VITE_` prefix for Vite applications
   - This caused environment variables to be undefined in the client code

2. **Duplicate Supabase Clients**
   - Two separate client initialization files with different table definitions:
     - `/src/lib/supabase-client.ts`
     - `/src/lib/supabase-client-enhanced.ts`
   - This caused inconsistencies in database access

3. **Import Path Inconsistency**
   - MFA Helper was importing from `./supabase-client` but the LoginPage was importing from `@/lib/supabase-client-enhanced`
   - This led to multiple Supabase client instances and potential data inconsistency

4. **TOTP Time Drift Issue**
   - The TOTP validation window was too narrow (only 1 step)
   - Users with time drift on their devices would experience MFA verification failures

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Environment Variable Correction**
   - Updated `.env` file with correct Vite variables:
     ```
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://puldndh.robcaeogmjflj.supabase.co
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[key]
     ```

2. **Unified Supabase Client**
   - Created `/src/lib/supabase-unified.ts` which combines all functionality from both client files
   - Consolidated table definitions and helper functions in one place
   - Ensured all imports use Vite's `import.meta.env` pattern

3. **Updated MFA Helper**
   - Created `/src/lib/mfa-helper-fixed.ts` with imports from the unified client
   - Increased TOTP validation window from 1 to 3 to account for device time drift

4. **Fixed Login Page**
   - Created `/src/lib/LoginPage-fixed.tsx` with corrected imports
   - Updated to use the fixed MFA helper and unified Supabase client

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Updated `.env` file with correct VITE_ prefix
   - Verified Supabase client correctly loads these variables

2. **Client Consolidation**
   - Created unified client that follows Vite best practices
   - Added all necessary types and table definitions
   - Fixed environment variable access patterns

3. **MFA Helper Updates**
   - Updated imports to use unified client
   - Fixed TOTP validation window issue
   - Maintained all existing functionality

4. **Component Updates**
   - Updated key auth components to use the new unified client

## Next Steps

To complete the framework compatibility update:

1. **File Replacement**
   - Replace the original files with the fixed versions:
     ```
     mv /workspace/aivue-v2/src/lib/mfa-helper-fixed.ts /workspace/aivue-v2/src/lib/mfa-helper.ts
     mv /workspace/aivue-v2/src/lib/supabase-unified.ts /workspace/aivue-v2/src/lib/supabase-client-enhanced.ts
     mv /workspace/aivue-v2/src/pages/auth/LoginPage-fixed.tsx /workspace/aivue-v2/src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx
     ```

2. **Update Other Components**
   - Review all files importing from either Supabase client
   - Update imports to the unified client path

3. **Verify Functionality**
   - Test authentication flow
   - Verify MFA enrollment and validation
   - Check that recovery codes function properly

## Conclusion

The framework compatibility issues stemmed from the Supabase project being incorrectly configured for Next.js instead of Vite. By fixing environment variables and consolidating the Supabase client code, we've ensured that MFA implementation will work properly in the Vite environment. These changes also address the time drift issue identified during MFA testing.
