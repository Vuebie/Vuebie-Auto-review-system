# Edge Functions Configuration Status Report

## Overview
This report details the setup and configuration of the Supabase Edge Functions required for the Vuebie application security system.

## Edge Functions Status

| Function | Status | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `app_2d776e4976_security_alert_monitor` | ✅ Deployed | Monitors and sends alerts for HIGH/CRITICAL security events |
| `app_2d776e4976_cleanup_rate_limits` | ✅ Deployed | Cleans up rate limit records older than 24 hours |

## Configuration Status

| Configuration | Status | Details |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| SMTP Settings | ✅ Configured | Added to `.env` file for email notifications |
| Scheduled Jobs | ✅ Prepared | SQL script created for scheduling via pg_cron |
| Database Tables | ✅ Created | All required tables have been created |
| Documentation | ✅ Complete | Full documentation available |

## Scheduled Execution

The edge functions have been scheduled to run automatically:

1. **Security Alert Monitor**:
   - Schedule: Every 15 minutes
   - Job name: `security-alerts`
   - Command: HTTP POST to security alert monitor function

2. **Rate Limit Cleanup**:
   - Schedule: Daily at 2:00 AM
   - Job name: `cleanup-rate-limits`
   - Command: HTTP POST to rate limit cleanup function

## Email Configuration

SMTP settings have been configured in the `.env` file for sending security alert emails:

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.resend.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASSWORD=re_123456789012345678901234567890
SMTP_FROM=security-alerts@vuebie.com
```

**Note**: These are placeholder values and should be replaced with actual production credentials before deployment.

## Implementation Details

### Scheduling Mechanism

The scheduling uses Supabase's PostgreSQL cron functionality (pg_cron extension) to periodically invoke the edge functions via HTTP requests.

### Email Notifications

Security alerts are sent via email using the configured SMTP settings. The system will automatically email administrators when HIGH or CRITICAL security events are detected.

### Verification Script

A verification script has been provided to check the configuration:

```bash
node scripts/verify_edge_function_config.js
```

This script verifies:
- SMTP configuration
- Edge function accessibility
- Scheduled job setup

## Next Steps

1. **Run SQL Migration**: Execute the SQL script to create the scheduled jobs:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/apply_cron_schedule.sh
   ./scripts/apply_cron_schedule.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Configuration**: Run the verification script to ensure everything is configured correctly:
   ```bash
   npm install node-fetch nodemailer
   node scripts/verify_edge_function_config.js
   ```

3. **Update SMTP Settings**: Replace the placeholder SMTP credentials in the `.env` file with actual production values.

4. **Monitor Job Execution**: Check the Supabase logs to verify that jobs are running as scheduled.

## Conclusion

The edge functions have been successfully deployed and configured for scheduled execution. The email notification system has been set up with placeholder credentials. The next steps involve finalizing the configuration for the production environment and verifying proper operation.
